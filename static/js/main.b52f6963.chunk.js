I\'m super excited for August and SF, and all the memories to come (especially the memory where I beat you at shot for shot) \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81","reactions":[{"reaction":"\xe2\x9d\xa4","actor":"Ilan Bigio"}],"type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1594413538397,"content":"You sent an attachment.","type":"Share"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1594071510463,"photos":[{"uri":"https://interncache-frc.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/83429462_1039819379801287_4966330786931173148_n.png?ccb=2&_nc_sid=73a6a0&efg=eyJ1cmxnZW4iOiJwaHBfdXJsZ2VuX2NsaWVudC9pbW9nZW46RFlJTWVkaWFVdGlscyJ9&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=interncache-frc&oh=df3c10ccb0f30cb5c3368419890566a1&oe=5FE84D03","creation_timestamp":1594071509}],"type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1594071473821,"content":"They just subscribed","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1594071431781,"content":"Oh hmm weird","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1594070230340,"content":"This person just cloned / accepted the repo","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1594069945152,"content":"Maybe I misread that the first time what does this mean!","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1594069925049,"content":"But also what why is it importing it?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1594069735510,"content":"Hahahaha we love a good systems summer","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1594065818748,"content":"Why","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1594065816384,"content":"Lol what","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1594065814741,"photos":[{"uri":"https://interncache-frc.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/106732289_285268352589462_684943946281589204_n.jpg?ccb=2&_nc_sid=73a6a0&efg=eyJ1cmxnZW4iOiJwaHBfdXJsZ2VuX2NsaWVudC9pbW9nZW46RFlJTWVkaWFVdGlscyJ9&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=interncache-frc&oh=85234f7f09aeb78bd71978ba28b7a78c&oe=5FE7EF93","creation_timestamp":1594065813}],"type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1593810593649,"content":"You sent an attachment.","type":"Share"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1593376499818,"content":"You sent an attachment.","type":"Share"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1592937292828,"content":"Oh yay!","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1592934130787,"content":"Also I got your yearbook!","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1592929212424,"content":"Yay very excited!","reactions":[{"reaction":"\xe2\x9d\xa4","actor":"Ilan Bigio"}],"type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1592929164459,"content":"sounds good! either one is fine with me","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1592928724484,"content":"It might depend a bit on when Jacob gets to the house too, because I need to be there to let him in.

I do have a couple concerns: firstly, it\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to data (not a bad thing, just something to note). Having the server/client I think could be both good and bad: they\xe2\x80\x99ll learn a little bit about how that works before their distributed assignment, which is good, but it may distract a little from the concurrency portion (maybe that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter too much.) Finally, maybe I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see it now but it feels like there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of complexity to the concurrency, just state management. We can\xe2\x80\x99t really iterate too much. It\xe2\x80\x99s just kind of like you either have a single client at a time with no concurrency, or multiple clients with full concurrency. One of the reasons I liked the bee hive idea was because it shows how concurrency can be used as an extra addition to a project. You can make an existing project have serial tasks first, then parallelism them and add concurrency.\\n\\nI think I\xe2\x80\x99d be down for any project where we can have a part that is implemented without concurrency first, to be slow, then add concurrency to make it faster. (On second thought, maybe even the Venmo one could first handle one client at a time on a loop, and then we can parallelize it? Idk) \\n\\nAnyway, those are my thoughts!","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1577036214002,"content":"Data?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1577035691887,"content":"Ahhh interesting, so like data but with clients also receiving requests","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1577035384406,"content":"Watered down venmo for the concurrency assignment.

It spawns a listening thread that listens for clients through sockets, and on a client connection it creates a thread that reads in commands from the client. A client can either add money to their bank account, request money from other clients, or send money to others. If the client requests money from another client, it will send that client a request.

On a few occasions in staff meeting, I also felt like you dismissed TAs ideas without even considering them. Lastly, I think it\'s odd that you instructed us to run a public test suite when the private test suite failed instead of just looking into how the private test suite work -- this clearly would lead to inconsistent grading, and if you had thought about this decision a little more I think you could\'ve realized this earlier. You\'re the HTA of a 350 person intermediate class -- your actions can have consequences.

I met Shelley our freshman year at Brown, when she was taking not only the Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science course, but also the Algorithms Analysis course, which is taken almost exclusively by juniors and seniors and is considered one of the hardest courses at Brown. Shelley has been a teaching assistant since her first year at Brown, for courses including Software Engineering and Algorithm Analysis, both for which she was later the head teaching assistant. Shelley has also actively participated in many clubs at Brown, including organizing the annual Brown hackathon, and is currently one of 3 departamental System Administrators \\n\\nHaving worked with Shelley as a TA and taken many courses together, I can speak first hand to her incredible ability to grasp and explain difficult topics, all while showing clear passion in them. I consider Shelley my mentor and role model, and I think she would be a great candidate to be a software engineer at Twitter.","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1566576138261,"content":"\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1566576047334,"content":"okee ill be back around then too","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1566576036596,"content":"here it tise","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1566575932474,"content":"tomorrow at 8:30pm ish","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1566575922973,"content":"What time will you be back in Providence?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1566575609944,"content":"Also I can send my resume","reactions":[{"reaction":"\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d","actor":"Ilan Bigio"}],"type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1566575605878,"content":"\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1566575604420,"content":"*please","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1566575598920,"content":"Hahaha yes pleade","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1566575587187,"content":"(I\'ll write one for you and then you can tell me if I missed anything?)","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1566574605421,"content":"also ur resume (they changed the system)","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1566574583575,"content":"I would be happy to come up with one, but twitter asks for a \\"Recommendation or comment\\".

This could happen after a project is due, possibly in class or required outside of class, so that 19 students not only learn from each other and take advantage of their respective backgrounds but also get to know each other. A variation of this could be to have one to three days after an assignment is due where students are put into groups (3 - 4) to implement or discuss possible implementations for an extended (more open ended) version of the assignment they just turned in.","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522362745927,"content":"What do you think of this idea?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1522359523495,"content":"Oh yes","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522359056166,"content":"?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522359054928,"content":"Also are you showing up to our hours in 90 minutes/","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522359033904,"content":"I feel like that\'s what TAing really is","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522359024528,"content":"I think I\'d love to be a 19 ta because I\'d get to re-take 19 without all the bullshit","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522358995529,"content":"I read the pyret front page for the first time and was blown away","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522358982793,"content":"Did you know pyret isn\'t really functional?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522358969640,"content":"Yeah that\'s the main one","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1522358922208,"content":"Applications of functional programming","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1522358150593,"content":"Hey!

As a mathematician, my answer is that game theory is mathematically interesting; I am content as long as I can study interesting models, develop interesting techniques to solve problems, and prove difficult results.\\n\\nBut some of us are closer to the real world than I am, and they claim that game theory is related to real problems. However, as we all know hardly any interactive situation that we encounter in real life fits any model of game theory. The prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s dilemma, which anyone who talks about game theory mentions, was already discussed in this blog, and people noted that the matrix description of the game does not match the actual interaction: Are there no consequences to the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 decisions? Does the matrix correctly identify the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 utilities? Are the utilities common knowledge? I am sure that anyone who reads this post will be able to raise more issues with the game representation of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s dilemma.\\n\\nAuctions are another widely cited application of game theory, where a solid theory has been developed. But take the simplest auction: a sealed-bid first-price auction with two bidders; the bidders fight over a contract to supply specific goods to some firm. You may actually encounter such auctions in practice. Now, suppose that you are bidder 1 (or that you are a consultant who was hired to assist bidder 1). Your private value is $1M: this is the minimum amount that you would ask for the contract. You believe that your private value is below the other bidder\xe2\x80\x99s private value by 10%. Well, about 10%. Because the marketing people of the other bidder may have convinced the board of directors that their actual private value is lower than $1.1M. Maybe $1.05M, or even $1M. What is the probability that the private value of the opponent is $1.1M, or $1.05M, or $1M? Give me a break, nobody can say. And what does the other bidder think about your private value? And is the distribution of the private value common knowledge? As you see, the great theory that the books tell us about is not much of a help.\\n\\nHaving said this, I do think that game theory is useful. In fact, very useful. And personally, I use it daily. As I see it, in any given interaction, game theory identifies aspects that each participant should consider before choosing an action. The basic model of game theory tells us that we should identify the game: who are the players, what are their actions, what are their goals. The area of Bayesian games tells us that we should think about the beliefs of the other players, their beliefs about other players\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs, and so on. The area of repeated games tells us that coordination can be achieved by means of threats. Sequential games draw our attention to commitments, subgame perfectness, reputation. Games played by automata help us understand the role of computational power. In short, as I see it, people who do \xe2\x80\x9creal-life\xe2\x80\x9d game theory develop models that provide insights concerning how to better understand various types of interactive situations. Personally, I like the insights that we as a group provide.","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1519771497267,"content":"Go get coffee and then meet me here?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519771450035,"content":"e","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519771448197,"content":"On my way, come get coffe?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519771437066,"content":"Hahaha woops","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1519771405875,"content":"I\'m literally in the room rn","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519771391551,"content":"Where are you?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519771388928,"content":"Also can we get coffee?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519771384601,"content":"You know, actually showing up to your job?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1519771013413,"content":"What do you mean?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519770977916,"content":"You planning on coming to hours this time?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519701833491,"content":"Nope, thanks!","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1519701398759,"content":"Want anything from Starbucks?","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519671219103,"content":"He agreed","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519671211648,"content":"One step ahead of you","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1519669422906,"content":"Joe\'s in the atrium go bug him","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1519666850532,"content":"Hahaha","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519665421258,"content":"Dude I\'m going to corner Joe today at grading \xf0\x9f\x98\x82","type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Shelley Jain","timestamp_ms":1519665041733,"sticker":{"uri":"messages/stickers_used/39178562_1505197616293642_5411344281094848512_n_369239263222822.png"},"type":"Generic"},{"sender_name":"Ilan Bigio","timestamp_ms":1519658886226,"content":"Maybe.
